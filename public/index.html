	<div>From the Firm that brought you the Pels CFB Bowl Confidence Pool&trade;Ô∏è and&nbsp;Pels Madness...</div><br>
<h2>‚õ≥ 2022-23 Pels Golf League ‚õ≥</h2>
<br>
<div>As we embark on the 2022-23 Pelicans season, The Firm has a big announcement that we hope will bring us all a little closer and perhaps make you some money in the process. The Pelicans will now be hosting a season-long golf fantasy league.&nbsp;This league will suit you well if you enjoy healthy office trash talk, casual golf watching, and/or winning money off Griff.</div>
<br>
<div>Here's how it works: you pick a team of 8 golfers for the season. The golfers have a "cap number" based on how much the experts believe they'll earn (your team has to be under the 16 point cap). Each week, the team whose golfers make the most money wins a weekly pot. At the end of the season, there's a season-long pot for the teams who earn the most.</div>
<br>
<h2>üí∞ Money / Payouts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>$5 per week where a PGA event is held</li>
    <li>$10 per week where a PGA major is held (The Players, The Masters, The PGA Championship, The US Open, British Open)</li>
    <li>30% of the collections will be paid to overall winners (top 3-5 depending how many entries we get)</li>
    <li>70% of the money will be paid out to weekly winners each week (1st and 2nd place each week)</li>
    <li>We will collect at the end of the year via Venmo</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>üî¢ Scoring</h2>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Weekly competitions will occur any weekend where a PGA or LIV event is happening, from the Sanderson Farms (9/29) through the BMW championship (8/17). <strong><em>In a normal season, we have 43 weeks of golf.</em></strong>
            <ul>
                <li>*NOTE* Our season ends after the BMW and doesn't include the Tour Championship
                </li>
                <li>
                    Any 2023 LIV events that occur after 8/20 will not count
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Any earnings made on the LIV tour will count as $0.27 for every $1.00 earned<ul>
                <li>For example, a LIV tournament winner will win $4M&hellip;.only $1.08M will count towards your team's total</li>
                <li>LIV golfer's individual earnings are counted, not the money earned by their LIV team</li>
                <li>This "exchange rate" is based on the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=saudi+riyal+to+usd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">actual exchange rate of the Saudi Riyal to the US Dollar</a></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If you have a golfer playing on LIV or the Euro tour on a weekend where no PGA event is being played, that money will not count.</li>
    </ul>
  <br>
  <h2>‚úèÔ∏è Entry</h2>

<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Feel free to use the attached Excel sheet to build your roster</li>
        <li>There's also a printable PDF attached with all the cap numbers if you prefer that</li>
        <li>Teams are due by the end of the day on Wednesday September 28</li>
        <li>Please send your teams to michael.hartman@pelicans.com</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>‚ùì FAQ</h2>
</div>
<div><u><em>What if a golfer on my team joins the LIV tour in the middle of the season?</em></u></div>
<div>
    That golfer will still be eligible for any earnings they make on the LIV tour or in Majors.

  <br>
    <div><u><em>Can I switch out a golfer on my team if they are injured or just not playing as well as I hoped?</em></u></div>
    <div>
        You have 1 &ldquo;Mulligan&rdquo; for the season that you can use to switch out a golfer. HOWEVER, your weekly fees for your team will <strong><u>DOUBLE</u></strong> up to <strong>$10</strong> a week and <strong>$20</strong> for Majors for the remainder of the season. You must stay under the total team cap when changing golfers.<br>
